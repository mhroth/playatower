# Playatower 2018

Playatower is an ongoing art project conceived in 2016 generally intended for Burning Man and related festivals. The Tower, or Beacon, is a two meter tall spiral of LEDs with the practical intention of acting as a widely visible location marker for an event or camp. Artistically the programmed light patterns are an exploration of mathematically chaotic systems, projected onto a one-dimensional manifold, two physical dimensions (in this case, a spiral), and the full visible light spectrum. Each pattern rhymes, it repeats but never exactly, intending to lure and enchant the viewer. The Beacon is a _Tripper Trap_.

The animations are based on a few mathematical principles, including chaotic oscillators (e.g. Lorenz, Chua, and Van der Pol), loosely-coupled oscillators (e.g. the firefly synchronisation effect), reaction diffusion systems, random walks, pheromone-based systems, and cellular automata. Ideally the uninformed viewer may simply be mesmerised by the patterns, while the more curious mind may venture down an infinite rabbit hole.
